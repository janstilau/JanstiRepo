Welcome to the online book of Qt5 Cadaques! Why Qt5? Because Qt5 is awesome! Why Cadaques? Because one of the authors had a great holiday in this rocky coastline in the north-east of Spain.

The entire collection of chapters covering Qt5 programming, written by Jürgen Bocklage-Ryannel and Johan Thelin, is available here.
