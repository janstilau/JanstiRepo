Giving Feedback
===============

We would love to receive your feedback. To be enable to make it as easy for you to provide feedback and for us to track the feedback we setup a github project to host the issue tracker.

You will see throughout the chapter a small highlighted box named *Issues*. There you have the create and view link. The create link creates a issue with the current chapter set as the label and pre-populates the body with the current document as a backlink. The view link allows you to see all issues recorded for this chapter. It filters the issues based on the current chapter.
